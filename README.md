## How It Works

### 1. Setup Your Scenario
- Enter your Google Gemini API key (secure and never stored)
- Select grade level (K-5, 6-8, 9-12, College)
- Enter subject area  
- Define learning outcomes
- List key concepts

### 2. Teaching Simulation
- AI generates a realistic student with specific misconceptions
- Chat with the student to understand their thinking
- Ask diagnostic questions to identify the root issue

### 3. Diagnosis & Intervention
- Select the misconception you've identified
- Provide your intervention strategy
- Get expert feedback on your teaching approach

### 4. Progress Tracking
- View session completion statistics
- Track diagnostic accuracy over time
- Monitor improvement in teaching skills

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Single-page HTML application with vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Gemini AI integration
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for session data
- **AI**: Google Gemini Pro for all AI interactions

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Serve frontend
- `POST /api/generate-scenario` - Create new teaching scenario
- `POST /api/student-response` - Get AI student response
- `POST /api/evaluate-session` - Evaluate teacher performance
- `GET /health` - Health check

## Security & Privacy

- **No server-side API keys**: Users provide their own Google Gemini API keys
- **Session-only storage**: API keys are only used during the session and never stored
- **Local data**: All progress tracking stored locally in your browser
- **No external dependencies**: Self-contained application

## Development

The app is designed to be simple and self-contained:
- All frontend code in `index.html`
- All backend logic in `simple_app.py`
- No complex database or external services
- Gemini AI handles all intelligent features
