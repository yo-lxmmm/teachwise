A simplified AI-powered teaching practice platform that helps educators diagnose and address student misconceptions through realistic classroom simulations.

## Features

üéØ **Simple Setup**: Teachers input grade level, subject, learning outcomes, and key concepts  
ü§ñ **AI Student Simulation**: Realistic student responses with authentic misconceptions  
üí¨ **Interactive Chat**: Natural conversation interface for diagnostic questioning  
üîç **Misconception Detection**: Multiple choice diagnosis with expert feedback  
üìä **Progress Tracking**: Session analytics stored locally  
üí° **Intervention Strategies**: Guided practice for addressing misconceptions  

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Gemini API key

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**:
```bash

- Enter subject area
- Define learning outcomes
- List key concepts

### 2. Teaching Simulation
- AI generates a realistic student with specific misconceptions
- Chat with the student to understand their thinking
- Ask diagnostic questions to identify the root issue

### 3. Diagnosis & Intervention
- Select the misconception you've identified
- Provide your intervention strategy
- Get expert feedback on your teaching approach

### 4. Progress Tracking
- View session completion statistics
- Track diagnostic accuracy over time
- Monitor improvement in teaching skills

## Architecture
